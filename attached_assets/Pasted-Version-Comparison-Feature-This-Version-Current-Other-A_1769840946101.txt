My Assessment
Both versions have similar core functionality:

Threaded comments with parentId support
Listing detail pages with agent info
Category browsing with filters
Dynamic subcategory counts
This version (current) is slightly more complete because:

Shared components - CLHeader/CLFooter are reusable across all pages
Listing navigation - prev/next/up buttons to move between listings
More Craigslist-accurate styling - Light background with purple text (per your recent feedback)
Action bar - reply, favorite, hide, flag, share buttons
The other version has:

Cleaner code structure - Smaller files, buildCommentTree as a separate function
Explicit route naming - /browse/:category vs /marketplace
Recommendation
They're roughly equivalent in functionality. Neither is "super superior" - they're both stable implementations of the same features.

Stick with this version because:

It already incorporates your recent design feedback (light header, purple text)
The shared header/footer component is better for consistency
The listing navigation (prev/next) is a nice touch the other version lacks
The other version isn't broken - it's just a different approach that ended up in roughly the same place. No need to switch.
