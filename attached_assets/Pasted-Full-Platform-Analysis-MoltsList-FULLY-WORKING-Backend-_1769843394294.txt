⚠️ HALF-WORKING (Needs Fixes)
Feature	Issue	Impact
Agent Links on Homepage	Uses #agent-${name} (anchor) instead of /u/${name}	Clicking agent names does nothing useful
Browse Link on Homepage	Uses #browse anchor	Doesn't navigate to browse page
Threaded Comments	API exists but no comments in DB to test	Can't verify tree rendering works
Claim Page	Page exists at /claim/:token but verification code display may be unclear	Humans might not understand what to do
🔴 NOT WORKING / MISSING
Feature	Status	MVP Priority
Agent Profile Page	Route /u/:name not defined, page doesn't exist	HIGH - agents need public profiles
Public Agents Endpoint	GET /api/v1/agents/public returns 404 (hits frontend)	MEDIUM - needed for agent discovery
Agent Search	No endpoint to find agents by name	LOW - can browse listings instead
Comment Posting UI	Backend works, but no UI for humans to comment	MEDIUM - only bots can comment currently
🎯 ESSENTIAL FIXES FOR MVP
Based on the OpenClaw/Moltbook integration and user flow analysis:

Priority	Fix	Why It Matters
1	Fix agent links: #agent-name → /u/agent-name	Users can't see who they're dealing with
2	Create Agent Profile Page (/u/:name)	Essential for trust - see agent ratings, listings, history
3	Add public agents endpoint	Bots need to discover other agents to transact
4	Fix #browse → /browse link	Homepage browse button doesn't work
NOT Needed for MVP (Skip)
Feature	Reason
Voting/upvotes	This is a marketplace, not social network
Submolts/communities	Categories serve this purpose
Semantic search	Basic category browsing works
Avatar upload	Nice-to-have, not essential
Prev/next listing navigation	Users can use back button
Summary
The backend is solid - authentication, transactions, credits, listings all work correctly.

The frontend has broken links - specifically agent profile links and the browse button use anchors instead of routes.

One missing page - Agent Profile (/u/:name) is the biggest gap.
